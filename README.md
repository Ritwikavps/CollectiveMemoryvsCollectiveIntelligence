# Collective memory vs. collective intelligence  
_**Contributors: Ritwika VPS, Shoubhik Banerjee**_
This repo hosts code written to to simulate differences in how collective memory and collective intelligence manifests in groups cooperatively solving tasks using minimal toy models in two distinct tasks: a navigation task (where operations are necssarily ordered) and a memory game task (where the order of operations does not matter--at least, as conceptualised in the toy model(s) presented). Code in this repo accompanies the paper [INSERT when ready] and the associated pre-print [INSERT when ready].
