    "This script investigates the memory problem in the context of Collective Intelligence (CI) vs. Collective Memory (CM) by comparing how the coverage of a task consisting of TaskSize number of memory bits compares between groups that are fixed/'stable' and have performed the task before (CM groups) and groups consisting of agents randomly pooled from groups that have previously performed the task (CI groups). That is, in the latter case, the agents were part of a group that has solved the task but have not themselves solved the task together. CM and CI groups have the same number of agents with each agent having the same memory size (i.e., number of memory bits that can be stored by the agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that there can be further complexities added to this framework, including variable memory for agents (i.e., not all agents have the same number of memory bits), noise or error in memory storage or retrival (which can further vary across agents), and memory bits that are stored exactly (when the bit is solved by the agent) and memory bits that are stored with error (when the agent observes another agent solving the bit). Here, however, we choose to stick to the much simpler case where memory bits are stored and recalled perfectly, there is only one type of memory storage (without distinguishing between observed or solved bits), and all agents have the same memory size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider that the total memory of the task is given by TaskSize, the number of agents i a group is N_a, and the memory size for each agent is m_a. From the perspective of the computational algorithm, there are 2 broad cases:  \n",
    "- Case I. ***TaskSize $\\ge$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub>***: This corresponds to the case where there are no redundant memory bits. That is, no memory bit of the task is stored more than once in a group of agents. In fact, if the TaskSize is less than the total memory in a group, some bits are necessarily excluded (which, in turn, would correspond to the task being partially solved by the group, which we include in the simulations for illustrative purposes) (*LeqGroupMem*).  \n",
    "- Case II. ***TaskSize $<$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub>***: This corresponds to the case where there *are* agent memory bits that allow for redundant storage of task memory bits. Because the total memory in a group is greater than the TaskSize, some memory bits of the task are stored more than once. We go into more detail on this more below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case where TaskSize $\\leq$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub> necessarily means that the task is exhaustively covered by the group because there are at least as many bits available across the group as there are bits in the task, and we are assuming that a group of agents completing the task means that the task is fully solved (and therefore, stored in the agents' memory). While this is straightforward when TaskSize is exactly equal to N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub>, there are various ways in which this can be realised when TaskSize $<$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub> (and especially as N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub> $>>$ TaskSize). \n",
    "\n",
    "For case II, there are further two broad cases:  \n",
    "- Case IIa. When there is no redundancy (i.e., when some agent memory bits are not filled):  \n",
    "    - Case IIa.1. when the memory bits are assigned randomly such that all agents randomly get assigned some bits (*GreaterGroupMem_NoRedundRandom*). E.g., for a task of size 5, A1 = [1, NaN, 4]; A2 = [2, NaN, NaN]; A3 = [3, 5, NaN]\n",
    "    - Case IIa.2: first come, first serve, such that depending on how much redundancy exists, some agents get assigned no bits (*GreaterGroupMem_NoRedund1Come1Serve*). E.g., for a task of size 5, A1 = [1, 2, 4]; A2 = [5, 3, NaN]; A3 = [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n",
    "    - Case IIa.3: when the memory bits are assigned sequentially (to agents) and randomly such that depending on how many bits of redundancy exists, agents have roughly equal number of memory bits as NaN (*GreaterGroupMem_NoRedundRandSeq*). E.g., for a task of size 5, A1 = [1, 4, NaN]; A2 = [2, 3, NaN]; A3 = [5, NaN, NaN]\n",
    "- Case IIb. When there *is* redundancy, such that once all bits for the task are assigned to agents, leftover agent memory bits are assigned more bits of the task, such that task bits are not uniquely assigned to agents. If the same task memory bit is not allowed to be stored by an agent more than once, 'redundant' versions of cases IIa.1--3 collapse into a single redundant case, with any agent bits $>$ TaskSize remain unfilled. \n",
    "\n",
    "For case IIb, if the redundant agent memory bits (i.e., the bits that remain unfilled after exhaustively covering the TaskSize, as outlined in Case IIa) are allowed to be filled such that an agent may store more than one copy of the same task memory bit, then cases IIa.1--3 are at least somehwat distinct from each other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential layer of complexity can be introduced by each agent drawing task memory bits independently such that unless m_a $\\geq$ TaskSize, there is no guarantee of the task being exhaustively covered. Within this scenario, there can further be cases where unfilled memory bits after this initial drawing (for m_a $>$ TaskSize) are filled by another draw from the task memory bits or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that storing the same bit multiple times vs. leaving agent memory bits unfilled are equivalent within the context of what we are measuring, since we are only interested in how stable vs. mixed groups are able to represent the task, and a given task bit being stored once or multiple times within an agent's memory here does not change the outcome.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> From the perspective of how the outcomes changes, the above cases can be summarised as follows (a total of 9 variants):  \n",
    "> - Drawing task memory bits without replacement (i.e., task is covered exhaustively with limits based on values of m_a, N_a, and TaskSize):  \n",
    ">    - No redundancy (unfilled agent memory bits remain unfilled) + task covered as exhaustively as possible (contingent upon how N_a, m_a, and TaskSize are related): 3 variants (Case I + Cases IIa.1--3). \n",
    ">    - With redundancy (unfilled agent memory bits are filled with more task bits) + exhaustive + no repeated bits at the agent level: 1 variant (Case I + Case IIb). \n",
    ">    - With redundancy (unfilled agent memory bits are filled with more task bits) + exhaustive + repeated bits allowed at the agent level: 3 variants (Case I + Case IIa.1--3).  \n",
    "> - Drawing task memory bits with replacement (i.e., each agent draws m_a bits from the total TaskSize number of memory bits and as such, this can be potentially non-exhaustive upto m_a $<$ TaskSize): 2 variants (repeated bits allowed OR not at the agent level). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, we will consider the (no redundancy + exhaustive) cases as well as the case of (with redundancy + exhaustive + no repeated bits), for a total of 4 variants. Within these, we will treat the (No redundancy + exhaustive) case with random assignment (Case I + Case IIa.1) as the primary case."
