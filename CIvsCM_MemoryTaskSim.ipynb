    "This script investigates the memory problem in the context of Collective Intelligence (CI) vs. Collective Memory (CM) by comparing how the coverage of a task consisting of TaskSize number of memory bits compares between groups that are fixed/'stable' and have performed the task before (CM groups) and groups consisting of agents randomly pooled from groups that have previously performed the task (CI groups). That is, in the latter case, the agents were part of a group that has solved the task but have not themselves solved the task together. CM and CI groups have the same number of agents with each agent having the same memory size (i.e., number of memory bits that can be stored by the agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that there can be further complexities added to this framework, including variable memory for agents (i.e., not all agents have the same number of memory bits), noise or error in memory storage or retrival (which can further vary across agents), and memory bits that are stored exactly (when the bit is solved by the agent) and memory bits that are stored with error (when the agent observes another agent solving the bit). Here, however, we choose to stick to the much simpler case where memory bits are stored and recalled perfectly, there is only one type of memory storage (without distinguishing between observed or solved bits), and all agents have the same memory size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider that the total memory of the task is given by TaskSize, the number of agents i a group is N_a, and the memory size for each agent is m_a. There are 2 broad cases:  \n",
    "- Case I. ***TaskSize $\\ge$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub>***: This corresponds to the case where there are no redundant memory bits. That is, no memory bit of the task is stored more than once in a group of agents. In fact, if the TaskSize is less than the total memory in a group, some bits are necessarily excluded (which, in turn, would correspond to the task being partially solved by the group, which we include in the simulations for illustrative purposes).\n",
    "- Case II. ***TaskSize $<$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub>***: This corresponds to the case where there *are* redundant memory bits. Because the total memory in a group is greater than the TaksSize, some memory bits of the task are stored more than once. \n",
    "\n",
    "The case where TaskSize $\\leq$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub> necessarily means that the task is exhaustively covered by the group because there are at least as many bits available across the group as there are bits in the task, and we are assuming that a group of agents completing the task means that the task is fully solved (and therefore, stored in the agents' memory). While this is straightforward when TaskSize is exactly equal to N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub>, there are various ways in which this can be realised when TaskSize $<$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub> (and especially as N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub> $>>$ TaskSize). \n",
    "\n",
    "For case II, there are further two broad cases:  \n",
    "- Case IIa. When there *is* redundancy, such that once all bits for the task are assigned to agents, leftover agent memory bits are assigned more bits of the task, such that task bits are not uniquely assigned to agents. If N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub> $>>$ TaskSize, then some bits may be stored multiple times by the same agent (while this is a little weird practically, computationally, storing the same bit multiple times vs. leaving agent memory bits unfilled are equivalent within this IIa context, since we are only interested in how stable vs. mixed groups are able to represent the task, and a given task bit being stored once or multiple times within an agent's memory under redundancy as stated here does not change the outcome.)\n",
    "- Case IIb. When there is no redundancy (i.e., when some agent memory bits are not filled):  \n",
    "    - Case IIb.1. when the memory bits are assigned randomly such that all agents randomly get assigned some bits. \n",
    "    - Case IIb.2: first come, first serve, such that depending on how much redundancy exists, some agents get assigned no bits. \n",
    "    - Case IIb.3: when the memory bits are assigned sequentially and randomly such that depending on how many bits of redundancy exists, agents have roughly equal number of memory bits as NaN\n",
