    "This script investigates the memory problem in the context of Collective Intelligence (CI) vs. Collective Memory (CM) by comparing how the coverage of a task consisting of TaskSize number of memory bits compares between groups that are fixed/'stable' and have performed the task before (CM groups) and groups consisting of agents randomly pooled from groups that have previously performed the task (CI groups). That is, in the latter case, the agents were part of a group that has solved the task but have not themselves solved the task together. CM and CI groups have the same number of agents with each agent having the same memory size (i.e., number of memory bits that can be stored by the agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that there can be further complexities added to this framework, including variable memory for agents (i.e., not all agents have the same number of memory bits), noise or error in memory storage or retrival (which can further vary across agents), and memory bits that are stored exactly (when the bit is solved by the agent) and memory bits that are stored with error (when the agent observes another agent solving the bit). Here, however, we choose to stick to the much simpler case where memory bits are stored and recalled perfectly, there is only one type of memory storage (without distinguishing between observed or solved bits), and all agents have the same memory size.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider that the total memory of the task is given by TaskSize, the number of agents in a group is N_a, and the memory size for each agent is m_a. From the perspective of the computational algorithm, there are 2 broad cases:  \n",
    "- Case I. ***TaskSize $\\ge$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub>***: This corresponds to the case where there are no redundant memory bits. That is, no memory bit of the task is stored more than once in a group of agents. In fact, if the TaskSize is greater than the total memory in a group, some bits are necessarily excluded (which, in turn, would correspond to the task being partially solved by the group, which we include in the simulations for illustrative purposes) (*LeqGroupMem*).  \n",
    "- Case II. ***TaskSize $<$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub>***: This corresponds to the case where there *are* agent memory bits that allow for redundant storage of task memory bits. Because the total memory in a group is greater than the TaskSize, some memory bits of the task are stored more than once. We go into more detail on this more below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case where TaskSize $\\leq$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub> necessarily means that the task is exhaustively covered by the group because there are at least as many bits available across the group as there are bits in the task, and we are assuming that a group of agents completing the task means that the task is fully solved (and therefore, stored in the agents' memory). While this is straightforward when TaskSize is exactly equal to N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub>, there are various ways in which this can be realised when TaskSize $<$ N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub> (and especially as N<sub>a</sub>m<sub>a</sub> $>>$ TaskSize). \n",
    "\n",
    "For case II, there are further two broad cases:  \n",
    "- Case IIa. When there is no redundancy (i.e., when some agent memory bits are not filled):  \n",
    "    - Case IIa.1. when the memory bits are assigned randomly such that all agents randomly get assigned some bits (*GreaterGroupMem_NoRedundRandom*). E.g., for a task of size 5, A1 = [1, NaN, 4]; A2 = [2, NaN, NaN]; A3 = [3, 5, NaN]\n",
    "    - Case IIa.2: first come, first serve, such that depending on how much redundancy exists, some agents get assigned no bits (*GreaterGroupMem_NoRedund1Come1Serve*). E.g., for a task of size 5, A1 = [1, 2, 4]; A2 = [5, 3, NaN]; A3 = [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n",
    "    - Case IIa.3: when the memory bits are assigned sequentially (to agents) and randomly such that depending on how many bits of redundancy exists, agents have roughly equal number of memory bits as NaN (*GreaterGroupMem_NoRedundRandSeq*). E.g., for a task of size 5, A1 = [1, 4, NaN]; A2 = [2, 3, NaN]; A3 = [5, NaN, NaN]\n",
    "- Case IIb. When there *is* redundancy, such that once all bits for the task are assigned to agents, leftover agent memory bits are assigned more bits of the task, such that task bits are not uniquely assigned to agents. If the same task memory bit is not allowed to be stored by an agent more than once, 'redundant' versions of cases IIa.1--3 collapse into a single redundant case, with any agent bits $>$ TaskSize remain unfilled. That is, if m<sub>a</sub> is larger than TaskSize, then all agents will perfectly store the task independently and remaining agent memeory bits will be unfilled.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential layer of complexity can be introduced by each agent drawing task memory bits independently such that unless m_a $\\geq$ TaskSize, there is no guarantee of the task being exhaustively covered. Within this scenario, there can further be cases where unfilled memory bits after this initial drawing (for m_a $>$ TaskSize) are filled by another draw from the task memory bits or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that storing the same bit multiple times vs. leaving agent memory bits unfilled are equivalent within the context of what we are measuring, since we are only interested in how stable vs. mixed groups are able to represent the task, and a given task bit being stored once or multiple times within an agent's memory here does not change the outcome.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> From the perspective of how the outcomes changes, the above cases can be summarised as follows (a total of 9 variants):  \n",
    "> - Drawing task memory bits without replacement (i.e., task is covered exhaustively with limits based on values of m_a, N_a, and TaskSize):  \n",
    ">    - No redundancy (unfilled agent memory bits remain unfilled) + task covered as exhaustively as possible (contingent upon how N_a, m_a, and TaskSize are related): 3 variants (Case I + Cases IIa.1--3). \n",
    ">    - With redundancy (unfilled agent memory bits are filled with more task bits) + exhaustive + no repeated bits at the agent level: 1 variant (Case I + Case IIb). Here, if there are unfilled agent bits after an initial exhaustive (upto limits imposed by TaskSize, m_a and N_a) apportioning of task memory bits, the remaining agent bits are filled (upto limits imposed by TaskSize, m_a and N_a) with more task bits, where bits are drawn from the task bit pool with replacement, subject to the constraint that an agent cannot have more than one copy of the same bit stored. That is, for the redundant memory apportioning, each agent is drawing from the pool of task bits minus bits already assigned to said agent. Therefore, cases IIa.1--3 collapse into the same case. \n",
    ">    - With redundancy (unfilled agent memory bits are filled with more task bits) + exhaustive + repeated bits allowed at the agent level: 1 variant (Case I + Case IIb).  Similarly as above, but with the secondary drawing for each agent from the full task bit pool, such that the secondary apportionment can be such that agents can have multiple copies of the same bit. However, the initial memory allocation is constrained by drawing from the task bit pool without replacement.\n",
    "> - Drawing task memory bits with replacement: there are different ways this can manifest. It could be that each agent draws m_a bits at once from the complete and total TaskSize number of memory bits and as such, this can be potentially non-exhaustive upto m_a $<$ TaskSize. It could also be that each agent draws each bit from a fresh pool of the total TaskSize number of memory bits. For the former case, there is no distinction between allowing further redundant filling of unallocated agent memory bits when m_a $>$ TaskSize. For the latter case, however, since each bit is independetly drawn, there can be non-exhaustive task coverage even when m_a $>$ TaskSize. 2 variants. Note that in both these 'drawing with replacement cases', the CM condition does not necessarily have to be deterministic since there is randomness introduced by the repeated drawing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this script, we will consider the (no redundancy + exhaustive) cases as well as the case of (with redundancy + exhaustive + no repeated bits), for a total of 4 variants. Within these, we will treat the (No redundancy + exhaustive) case with random assignment (Case I + Case IIa.1) as the primary case."

    "- It might be worth it to also show a difference in performance plot as a third heat map subplot? In particular, to show how as T becomes greater than m_a and N_a, we see that the collective memory advantage diminishes? Current plan: show raw (or as proportion of task size) excluded bits for CI and CM separaely.\n",
    "- Might we see negative performance for CM as T >> ? This does not seem to be the case\n",
    "- Is the following framing correct? (THINK about this more): For case IIb, if the redundant agent memory bits (i.e., the bits that remain unfilled after exhaustively covering the TaskSize, as outlined in Case IIa) are allowed to be filled such that an agent may store more than one copy of the same task memory bit, then the equivalent cases to cases IIa.1--3 are at least somehwat distinct from each other. Response: I am not sure what I was trying to convey here, but I don't think this is the case, as long as *all* redundant bits are filled and having repeated bits would mean drawing from Task Size pool with replacement, and that approach (as outlined in more detail in the initial markdown) feels more general than drawing exhaustaively and without replacement from TaskSize initially and *then* drawing again to fill redundant bits with replacement (although, could be an interesting specific case to explore?)\n",
    "- Re: looking at higher values of TaskSize to see how higher T/N_a or T/m_a values behave re: excluded CI bits: Note that the python plots look like there is only high failure (excluded bits) in CI because the x and y axes scale is not linear wrt to the actual tick values i.e., the tick values are not equally spaced. Rather, each Na or m_a value is plopped next to each other at the same 'distance' without consideration for whether the two values are 1 and 1.1, or 6 and 20. This makes it look like the highest CI excluded bits are always at the very top right corner when it actually is just that these values are squished into that corner with not-to-scale axes"
