    "This file contains code to run robustness checks to show that for cases where task size $\\geq$ total pooled memory at the group-level (i.e., T $\\geq$ N_a m_a such that the task is, at best, minimally covered--for T = N_a m_a), the NoRedundRandom, NoRedund1Come1Serve, and NoRedundRandSeq task bit allocation protocols are functionally equivalent (and therefore, we can use the NoRedundRandom protocol for these cases across the board, from a computational implementation sense, as we have chosen to do in the core simulation code: a_M1_CIvsCM_MemortTaskSim.ipynb and the associated function file: Fns_MemoryTaskSim.py. Note that the RedundNoRepBits protocol is only different--operationally and functionally--from the NoRedundRandom protocol when T < N_a m_a and as such, the NoRedundRandom protocol is used to obtain results for the RedundNoRepBits protocol when T $\\geq$ N_a m_a). This equivalence is because CM vs CI performance is not concerned with the identity of the task bits or the agent memory bits, and only with the degree of task coverage achieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that when T $\\geq$ N_a m_a, the NoRedundRandom and NoRedund1Come1Serve protocols are operationally and functionally equivalent (again in terms of metrics we care about), and therefore, this equivalence demo does not test for equivalence between these to protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Admittedly, this demo comes out of choices made early on in how the core simulation code is set up: in the core sim code, for all T $\\geq$ N_a m_a--i.e., as long as the pooled group memory is not greater than the task size, such that all agent memory bits are always assigned a task bit--task bit allocation is done using the NoRedundRandom protocol. This is based on the reasoning that operationally and functionally, i.e., for effects we care about--only how much of the task is covered in CI vs CM, not the details of how the task is covered, which bits are excluded, etc.--the NoRedundRandom protocol is equivalent to the NoRedund1Come1Serve, and NoRedundRandSeq protocols. However, for completeness's sake, it is good to verify this computationally, which is what this script does. Since the RedundNoRepBits protocol only kicks in when there are agent memory bits that can be redundantly assiged after full task coverage--and therefore, necessarily only when T < N_a m_a, there is no need to test this protocol against the others when T $\\geq$ N_a m_a. At any rate, the core sims could have been set up differently by explicitly using NoRedundRandom, NoRedund1Come1Serve, and NoRedundRandSeq protocols when T $\\geq$ N_a m_a as well as T < N_a m_a, but I am choosing not to change the core sims and instead, just doing these checks in this script)"
